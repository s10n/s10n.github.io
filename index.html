      <strong>Voting system</strong> - A mobile voting system sold in two Korean broadcasters.
      The competition television series are very popular nowadays for many years.
      On this platform, there is always a voting system for audience.
      In the past, they used the mechanical remote control to count the votes of the audience.
      Our team has built a mobile web app that counts the votes of the audience.
      The system displays voting results in real-time on the director's screen.
      The shooting team directly supported training and management in the field,
      so that they could concentrate on their mission.
      We provided services to SBS and CJ Entertainment, major broadcasting companies.
      Real-time communication was implemented with <a
      href="https://socket.io" target="_blank">Socket.IO</a> and Node.js.
      I designed and published the app, led the team and contracted with the station.
      You can see how it was used on <a

      <strong>Guideline.website</strong> (Writing) - <a
      href="http://guideline.website" target="_blank">"How do I create a website?"</a>
      is a document that expands the order in which I create websites.
      I wrote an overview and references for the process of creating a website.
      These are what I learned from running a web agency for two years from 2013 to 2014.
      I wrote for myself and for in-house training. It is written in Korean.
